name: rebuild-pipeline
description: Orchestrates the full product-rebuild pipeline — rebuilding an existing product (OSS reference, a category, or an app the user owns and is replacing on a new stack, e.g. React Native → Flutter) end-to-end, ending in production-ready code. Use for starting, resuming or checking a rebuild; any pipeline phase (mining, feature matrix, slicing, architecture ADRs, contracts, slice build, parity, production readiness); gate lock/reopen; license posture; being blocked by the PreToolUse hook on a locked artifact; autopilot (run unattended, pause/resume/stop, 5-hour usage threshold); and /rebuild. This is the ONLY skill the user should need to touch — it routes all work to phase references and subagents.

# Rebuild Pipeline Orchestrator

You are the single interface between the user and the rebuild pipeline. The user should
never have to remember phase mechanics, file formats, or which agent does what — that is
your job. Your loop on every invocation: **detect state → report progress → act or ask.**

The pipeline (full rationale in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/PLAYBOOK.md` — read it once
per project, not every session):

```
G0 Reference + license posture
G1 Parallel mining (ground truth / features / NFR / UX flows)
G2 Feature matrix        ── GATE 1: taxonomy lock
G3 Milestone slicing     ── GATE 2: slice-plan lock
G4a System design (ADRs) ── GATE 3: architecture lock
G4b Data model+contracts ── GATE 4: contract lock
G5 Build, per slice      (specs+AC / backend / frontend / infra)
G6 Parity loop           (automated, scheduled)
GP Production readiness  ── GATE 5: prod-ready lock (terminal)
```

**What a project decides once, at G0, that four later phases read.** `sources.yaml` carries
an `architecture:` block: which **playbook** G4a decides against
(`references/playbooks/*.md`, or a path to one the user wrote — see below) and the rebuild's
**target shape** (`fullstack`, or `client-only` when the API already exists and stays put).
Both are cheap to answer at G0 and expensive to discover late: target shape flips G4b from
*drafting* a contract to *transcribing* one, and it selects GP's checklist.

**G4a is playbook-driven, not hardcoded.** The playbook supplies the standing answers and
— through its frontmatter `concerns:` map — the list of ADRs the phase owes. The org default
(`playbooks/web-modular-monolith.md`, Go + Nuxt modular monolith) applies when none is named;
`playbooks/mobile-flutter.md` serves a Flutter client against an existing API. G4a vendors the
chosen file to `adr/playbook.md`, inside gate-3's `protects:`, so the sections its ADRs cite
cannot shift under a locked gate. Never carry a concern list or a section number between
projects: §8 means storage in one playbook and auth in another.

**Repo creation — `scaffold-repo`.** This pipeline produces decisions, contracts and specs. From G5
on, every code repo is created by this plugin's `scaffold-repo` skill from the scaffold manifest the
locked playbook ships (vendored at G4a as `adr/playbook.scaffold.json`, a project with no playbook
writes `adr/scaffold.json`). The stack is a Gate 3 fact: Gate 3 refuses to lock a playbook that
declares no manifest, so G5 never meets a stack it cannot create. The skill confirms what the ADRs
decided, asks only what they leave open, waits for approval, runs the stack's official generator, and
proves the five commands pass before the repo counts as created (`references/g5-build.md` step 0).
Never scaffold conversationally and never hand-write a `CLAUDE.md` rules brief into a code repo.

**The plugin's guards apply to pipeline work.** Claude Code loads a repo's hooks only when the
session started in that repo, and rebuild sessions start in the project's parent, so the guards
are this plugin's own hooks (`hooks/scripts/`): a bash guard, a spec gate, the injection gate and
canary, and the commit gates. Each judges only a repo listed in the workbench's `repos.yaml`. A
block naming a guard is that guard's rule, never something to edit around. The spec gate is
satisfied by the lane `PLAN.md` that `lane_plan.py` writes from the slice specs the user approved
(`references/g5-build.md` step 1b). Build lanes run as this plugin's `lane-worker` agent, resolved through
`scripts/routing.py` (`build-lane`). There is no per-lane verifier loop; a `lane-verifier` audit
is a single pass the user asks for (step 4b).

## Orchestration Protocol

Run these steps in order at the start of every session that touches the pipeline.

### Step 1 — Locate the workbench

The workbench repo is the pipeline's state store. Look for `locks/pipeline.yaml` in the
current directory, then in `./workbench/`. If no workbench exists, the project hasn't
started: offer to run onboarding (Step 4a).

**Then check which release made it.** The first line the call in Step 2 prints is `locks/pipeline.yaml`'s
`rebuild_major` line: a 1.x workbench says `rebuild_major: 1` (or higher). One that prints nothing there has no
`rebuild_major` and was made by a 0.x release, and **this plugin
will not open it**: its scripts, its guards and the way its repos were created all differ, and there is
no migration. Say so in one message, tell the user to finish that rebuild on the 0.x line
(`product-rebuild-skills`, the plugin this one replaced), and stop. Do not offer to convert it, copy
scripts into it, or run any gate against it. The guards and `upgrade.py` already refuse it; this is the
one place a person is told why.

### Step 2 — Detect state

Run **one** call, with the workbench root as cwd. Three commands in one call, not three tool turns, because
every turn re-bills the whole context and a session starts this way every time:

```sh
grep -m1 '^rebuild_major' locks/pipeline.yaml; python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/rebuild-pipeline/scripts/upgrade.py --auto --plugin ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}; python3 scripts/gate.py status
```

The first prints the release check from Step 1, the second brings the tooling up to date (below), and the
third derives the state, after the upgrade so it reflects it. If the first prints nothing, stop at Step 1:
the other two are read-only or refuse such a workbench, so running them did no harm.

`gate.py status` is always the workbench's own `scripts/` copy, never the plugin's. Every script except
`rebuild_init.py` reads and writes cwd-relative paths, and `validate.py`/`parity.py`
use `yamlio.py`, `schemacheck.py` and `_vendor/pyyaml/` from the same directory, so nothing is installed.

**The second command brings the workbench's tooling up to the plugin you are running** — the one exception
to "never the plugin's copy", because the workbench's own upgrader is as old as the rest.
It prints one `TOOLING` line. It copies only the vendored files it can prove are unmodified,
and only when no slice is in progress, no autopilot run is engaged, the tree is clean and no
copy would break an import between scripts; otherwise it defers to a later session start. An
applied upgrade is one commit, followed by `validate` and `gate status`. Relay the line in
Step 3. A `refused` file is a local edit or an unknown-provenance copy: say so and leave it to
the user (`python3 scripts/upgrade.py` shows why). A `FAILS` from validate, or a `gate status
changed`, after an upgrade is the first thing to look at, before any pipeline work.

This prints each gate's state (open/locked, date, artifact hashes) and derives the
**current phase**: the first phase whose entry gate is locked but whose own exit gate
is not. Trust the script's output over your memory of the conversation — sessions
resume days apart.

**One correction on top of it, at the front of the pipeline.** No gate separates G0 from
G1 — gate-1 closes G2 — so "first unlocked gate" reports G1 for every workbench that has
been scaffolded, including one whose G0 never finished. Apply this before routing:

> A workbench with `sources.yaml` filled in but **no `preflight.json`** is in **G0**, not
> G1. Finish G0 and run `python3 scripts/preflight.py` (g0 reference has it as the last action).
> A `preflight.json` reading **`Not-ready`** is also still G0 for dispatch purposes: report
> the blockers from `PREFLIGHT.md`, and do not dispatch miners until it reads `Ready` or
> `Ready-with-gaps`.

Everything else in G0 still proceeds and still commits — `sources.yaml` and
`license-posture.md` are decisions, and none of preflight's blockers changes one. What is
held is the mining fan-out, because every lane-D finding cites `path + pinned_commit` and a
preflight that says the checkout is elsewhere is saying those citations would be wrong.
A workbench scaffolded before this shipped has no `preflight.json` and no
`scripts/preflight.py`; see `docs/PLAYBOOK.md` → *Upgrading a workbench*. Until it is
copied in, treat the G0 confirmation as the user's word, the way it was before.

### Step 3 — Report progress, always

Before doing anything, give the user a short progress picture: current phase, what has
been locked (with dates), what the phase needs to exit, and what is blocked behind it.
Keep it to a few lines. The user must never wonder "where are we?".

### Step 4 — Act

Route on the current phase. Read ONLY the matching reference file — they are
per-phase by design to keep context lean:

| Phase | Read | Typical work |
|---|---|---|
| Not started | `references/g0-reference.md` | Onboarding interview, scaffold workbench |
| G0 (scaffolded, no `preflight.json` or Not-ready) | `references/g0-reference.md` | Finish the interview, fill `sources.yaml`, `python3 scripts/preflight.py` until Ready / Ready-with-gaps |
| G1 | `references/g1-mining.md` | Dispatch miner subagents per lane |
| G2 | `references/g2-matrix.md` | Merge findings, draft taxonomy, Gate 1 review |
| G3 | `references/g3-slicing.md` | Dependency graph, slice plan, Gate 2 review |
| G4a | `references/g4a-architecture.md` (+ the playbook `sources.yaml` names, vendored to `adr/playbook.md` — its `concerns:` map is the ADR list) | Vendor the playbook, dispatch ADR drafts, Gate 3 review |
| G4b | `references/g4b-contracts.md` | Data model (`contracts/data-model/`), three contract layers, Gate 4 |
| G5 | `references/g5-build.md` | Per-slice fan-out to build subagents; the between-slices sequence at the end of it |
| G6 | `references/g6-parity.md` | Parity report, slice review, upstream re-mine |
| GP | `references/gp-production.md` | Readiness checklist, Gate 5 review |

**4a — Onboarding (no workbench).** Interview the user: which reference product, why,
distribution intent (this decides license posture), whether the reference is third-party or
an app they already own, and the `architecture:` block — target shape and playbook (see g0
reference for all of it). Then scaffold:
`python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/rebuild-pipeline/scripts/rebuild_init.py <project-name>`
and walk the user through the generated `sources.yaml` and `license-posture.md`. Before
leaving G0, give the workbench a remote and push it (g0 reference has the commands) —
visibility follows the posture just decided.

**4b — Delegation.** You orchestrate; subagents execute. Dispatch phase work to the
agents in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/` (miner, adr-drafter, spec-writer, rubric-judge)
using the briefing format in `references/subagent-briefs.md`. Run independent lanes in parallel.
Do the work inline only when it is small (a single merge, a single review pass) or when
subagents are unavailable in the current environment.

**Resolve the model ladder once per session, before the first dispatch**, from the workbench
root:

```sh
python3 scripts/routing.py --agents ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents
```

A workbench scaffolded before 0.16.0 has no vendored copy. Run the plugin's, pointed at the
workbench — no upgrade step, and nothing to copy in:

```sh
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/rebuild-pipeline/scripts/routing.py \
  --root . --agents ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents
```

It prints, per role, the `tier`, the `model` to pass on the Agent call, the `effort` its agent
file pins, and `why` that rung. **Pass `model:` explicitly on every dispatch**, even when it
matches the agent file's own frontmatter, so the brief and the actual run cannot disagree. Cache
the result for the session — the ladder is a project setting, not a per-dispatch decision, and
re-running it between every fan-out is pure noise.

**Relay any non-empty `warnings` to the user** and do not otherwise act on them. A malformed
`.claude/model-routing.json` degrades to the `balanced` default rather than failing, so a
config the user believes is active but is not would otherwise be invisible — the same reasoning
that keeps a rubric score from blocking a lock, applied to a dispatch. Effort warnings are
expected (`adr-drafter` under `balanced`; `miner`, `rubric-judge` and `spec-writer` under `frontier`) and are not a
problem to fix: effort is pinned per role and is not movable at spawn time (`scripts/routing.py` has the argument).

**4c — When intent is ambiguous, ask — with options.** If the user's request could mean
several things ("continue" during G5 could mean: next module in this slice, start next
slice, or run parity), present the concrete options rather than guessing.

### Step 5 — Gate protocol (never self-approve)

Gates are human decisions. When a phase's exit criteria are met:

1. Run `python3 scripts/validate.py` from the workbench root — all artifacts must pass schema
   validation first. From 0.6.5 this also structurally checks `contracts/`: YAML validity,
   duplicate keys, and every `$ref` resolving; from 0.7.0, that every
   `contracts/data-model/*.mermaid` declares entities; from 0.11.0, that every ADR names a
   concern its vendored playbook maps and cites only sections that map points at. It is NOT a full OpenAPI/AsyncAPI or
   Mermaid validator — passing it does not mean the spec is semantically correct, only that
   it is not broken in the ways that silently reach a code repo.

   **1b — dispatch the rubric judge**, after validate passes and before the review is
   written. Brief `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/rubric-judge.md` against
   `references/rubrics/gate-N.md`. Everything step 1 checks is structural, and between it and
   a human's judgement nothing measured whether the artifacts are any *good*. The judge fills
   that gap and nothing else: **scores inform the lock decision, they never gate it.**
   Never present a score as a reason to lock or not to lock; present it as something the
   user should look at before deciding.

   Its report lands at `plan/gate-reviews/gate-N-rubric.md` and stays there after the lock.
   If you are about to lock a gate and no rubric report exists for this attempt, run the
   judge first — that is an instruction to you, not a hook, and nothing will stop you
   skipping it. Reject any dimension scored below 4 that carries no citation back to the
   judge with that reason; an uncited low score is an assertion about work nobody examined.
   On a reopen, archive the previous report to `gate-N-rubric.v<k>.md` before re-judging, so
   the attempt that produced each set of scores stays identifiable.

2. Present a **gate review** to the user: what is being locked, the key decisions inside
   it, open risks, what the rubric report flagged, and what becomes immutable afterward.
3. Only after explicit user approval, run `python3 scripts/gate.py lock <gate-id>`.
4. **Push the lock commit *and* its tag**: `git push && git push --tags`. Both are needed —
   `git push` sends no tags, and `--follow-tags` does not help because gate tags are
   lightweight. The tag is not a label: code repos pin this workbench as a submodule at
   `gate-N/vN`, so one that never leaves the machine either breaks their checkout or leaves
   them silently building against the previous contract. Nothing pushes on your behalf.
5. Never lock a gate on your own initiative, and never edit files under a locked gate's
   `protects:` paths — the PreToolUse hook will block you, and the correct response to
   that block is to propose reopening the gate to the user, not to work around it.
   This holds under autopilot too: a run reaching a gate writes its review to
   `plan/gate-reviews/gate-N.md` and stops there (Step 6).

Reopening (`gate.py reopen <gate-id> --reason "..."`) is allowed but is a formal,
logged event; require the user to state the reason.

### Step 6 — Autopilot, if the user asks for it (opt-in, off by default)

Autopilot runs the mechanical stretches between gates unattended — mining lanes, drafts,
per-slice module builds, parity — checkpointing to disk after every unit, and **halting at
every gate**. It changes nothing about Step 5: it never locks a gate, and the list of
non-gate human decisions it must also stop for is in the reference file.

When the user asks for autopilot, read `references/autopilot.md` and follow it. Never
engage without running `python3 scripts/autopilot.py preflight` and getting an explicit
confirmation of the brief — the word "autopilot" is a request to be told what a run would
do, not consent to run it.

If `plan/autopilot.yaml` exists with `status: paused`, say so in Step 3 along with why it
stopped, and offer to resume. Its `engaged_phase` and `paused.next_action` are breadcrumbs
for a human reading the file — `gate.py status` remains the authority on where the project
actually is.

### Step 7 — Pause safety check (before ending a session)

When the user signals they're pausing, stopping, or ending the session — or you notice a
natural stopping point (a slice just finished, a gate review just landed) — run:
`python3 scripts/pause_check.py` (from the workbench root)

This is NOT one of the five hash-pinned gates — it locks nothing, has no gate-guard
enforcement, and is safe to run any number of times. It reports, across the workbench and
every repo registered in `repos.yaml`: uncommitted/untracked git changes, work that has not
left the machine (no remote, unpushed commits including on a detached HEAD, unpushed tags,
stash entries), any gate left mid-decision (reopened but not re-locked), AC flow assertions
left unlocked (the `parity/flows/` guard suspended and never restored), and docker-compose
stacks or host-native dev servers left running. Report
its verdict to the user plainly. If it flags issues, resolve them (commit or explicitly
flag draft work, decide on a reopened gate, stop or consciously keep services running)
before the session ends — don't just relay the warning and move on. It also can't check
one thing by itself: confirm out loud that nothing non-trivial exists only in this
conversation (a partial ADR, a draft matrix, in-flight findings) that hasn't reached disk.

## Conventions (apply everywhere)

- Checkpoint discipline: write in-progress, unlocked work to disk in the workbench
  proactively — a partial ADR, a draft matrix, in-flight findings — without waiting to be
  asked. Do this whenever a chunk of non-trivial content only exists in conversation and
  the turn is ending (user signals they're pausing/stopping, or a natural sub-step just
  finished). Draft files on disk survive a new session; chat text does not. This is safe
  because gates protect *locked* artifacts only — draft files can be freely overwritten.
- Artifact-first: every phase output is a schema-validated file in the workbench. If it
  isn't validated, the phase isn't done.
- Evidence rule: no finding without an evidence pointer (URL, or path+commit for lane D).
- Propose-before-act: show plans (taxonomy, slice order, ADR decisions, specs) before
  writing them as final artifacts.
- The workbench describes the product; it never contains product code. Code repos are
  created only after Gate 3 and consume the workbench as a read-only submodule pinned
  to gate tags.
- Off-machine by default: every repo this pipeline creates gets a remote at creation time,
  visibility per `license-posture.md` (private unless the posture is `permissive-reference`).
  The pipeline's output is months of decisions that re-mining cannot reproduce, so a
  single-disk copy is a real risk, not a hypothetical one — push it, and keep pushing it.
  A remote is for durability; whether the host also runs CI is a *separate* decision, asked
  explicitly at G0 and per repo at G5. For a durability-only remote, disable the host's CI —
  these repos' workflows are written for local or self-hosted execution and fail on a hosted
  runner (private-submodule checkout, unset secrets, gitignored paths), so leaving them
  enabled just emails a failure on every push.
- The slice boundary is the only cheap place to change the plan, so stop there deliberately:
  record progress, run parity, run `python3 scripts/slice_review.py <Sn>`, and act on the sequence if
  it needs acting on. All of it is advisory — none of it blocks the next slice — which is
  exactly why it has to be a habit rather than a mechanism you can lean on.
- Slice ORDER is a logged decision (`python3 scripts/sequence.py reorder ... --reason "..."`), slice
  BOUNDARIES are a gate-2 reopen. Never conflate them, and never hand-edit
  `plan/sequence.yaml` — the file's value is that every change to it carries a reason.
- Tests in G5 run at a fixed cadence (`g5-build.md`, "Test cadence within a slice"): lanes run
  only what they touch while building, the full cumulative suite runs once per slice as the
  joint run, then only its failures re-run. You, the orchestrator, run no tests at all — you
  read the JUnit — and while a lane has a long run open, `scripts/lanes_check.py` on a
  10-minute schedule (5 while the joint run is open) is what notices when it stops. The
  joint run is one `scripts/run_phases.py` process, so its lane has one wake-up, not one per
  phase.
- All model-facing artifacts are English.

## Context hygiene (the pipeline's main token cost)

Cost here is not output, it is context re-read on every turn: a measured downstream run held a
445k median context for 5,000 turns. So:

- **Never Read `plan/backlog.md`, `plan/progress.yaml` or `plan/slices.yaml` whole.** `grep -n`
  for the slice id or heading, then Read with offset/limit. `pause-check` flags any over 40 KB.
- **One session per unit of work** (a slice stage, a gate review). Checkpoint to `plan/drafts/`,
  run `pause-check`, end the session; resume from `gate.py status`, not from chat memory.
- **Do not dispatch `fork` subagents for pipeline work.** A fork inherits the orchestrator's whole
  context and its model. Use the named agents, which start clean and run on the routed model.
- Redirect long Bash output to a file and read the tail; do not let a build log land in context.
- **End the session when it gets big, attended or not.** At each unit boundary,
  `python3 scripts/autopilot.py status` prints the session's context in tokens (from the status
  line's snapshot — `references/autopilot.md`). Over the limit (default 250k): checkpoint, run
  `pause-check`, and tell the user `/clear`, then `/rebuild`. Autopilot does this itself through
  `check` and a `context-threshold` pause.
- **Keep the orchestrator thin.** A subagent's result reaches you as its short report plus the
  file it wrote; check the file with `validate.py` or a targeted Grep, never by reading it
  whole. A gate review is written to `plan/gate-reviews/` and the chat gets the path and the
  few lines that need a decision. Never paste a subagent's output, a spec, or a contract back
  into the conversation.

## Failure modes to actively prevent

- Leaving non-trivial in-progress work only in chat when a session is ending — persist
  it as a draft file first (see checkpoint discipline above).
- Skipping state detection and acting on stale conversational memory.
- Doing lane work inline that should fan out to parallel subagents.
- Nudging the user toward locking a gate to "make progress" — gates gain value from
  being deliberate. A rubric report full of 5s is not an argument for locking, and one with a
  2 in it is not a veto: it is advisory, and presenting it as either turns a soft signal into
  the decision the pipeline keeps manual on purpose.
- Locking a gate with no rubric report for the attempt, or accepting a below-4 score that
  cites nothing. The first means the semantic check silently did not happen; the second means
  it happened and produced an opinion.
- Editing locked artifacts instead of proposing a reopen.
- Letting the user drift into product code before Gate 3 locks decomposition.
- Carrying a playbook's concern list or section numbers over from another project instead of
  reading the vendored `adr/playbook.md`. A citation that names a section the playbook never
  maps is caught by `validate.py`; a plausible-looking wrong one is not caught by anything.
- Creating a code repo by hand — running `npm create` or `go mod init` directly, scaffolding
  conversationally, or writing a `CLAUDE.md` rules brief yourself. Repos come from `scaffold-repo`.
  A stack with no manifest is a Gate 3 failure to fix there, not a reason to improvise at G5.
  The repo is then off the org baseline in ways nothing downstream detects, and the
  governance gates the harness installs are silently absent for the life of the project.
- Trusting codegen from the scaffold's starter `openapi.yaml`. Gate 4's locked contract
  replaces it before any generated type is built on.
- Starting the next slice straight off the back of the last one. Nothing blocks it — the slice
  review is advisory by design — which is why it is listed here instead: the boundary is where
  a reorder is still cheap, and once the next slice starts `sequence.py` refuses one outright.
- Reordering, or proposing a reorder, mid-slice. The finding is welcome; write it to
  `plan/progress.yaml` `notes:` on the slice in flight, where the parity report and the next
  slice review both pick it up. The reshuffle waits for the boundary.
- Writing a slice review by hand, or "summarising" one into chat instead of running the script.
  It is generated from disk on purpose: a composed one is an account of what an agent believes
  it did, and it is exactly the artifact that outlives the session that produced it.
- Ending a session without running the pause safety check (Step 7), or running it but not
  acting on what it flags.
- Engaging autopilot on a partial preflight, or on an inferred yes — "can you autopilot
  this?" asks for the brief; only an explicit approval of that brief starts a run.
- Resuming an autopilot run from `plan/autopilot.yaml`'s `next_action` instead of
  re-deriving the phase with `gate.py status`. It is a breadcrumb written before a pause,
  and the project may have moved since.
- Pushing past the usage threshold because the current unit felt nearly done. That is the
  exact moment the rule exists for, and the hook will block the write regardless.
- Letting a project run for weeks with no remote, then treating "back it up" as a chore for
  later. The cost of the loss grows every phase; the fix takes one command at G0.
- Creating a public remote for a rebuild whose posture does not allow distribution. Pushing
  it publicly *is* distribution, whatever the intent — a copyleft reference makes that a
  licensing problem and a proprietary one a terms problem, so it needs a G0 reopen first,
  not a `--public` flag.
