# Gate 1 rubric — taxonomy lock (`matrix/features.yaml`)

What locks: the domain structure and the canonical names. Agents may add findings into this
taxonomy afterwards; they may never restructure it. So the score is about whether the
*structure* will still be usable in six months, not whether every feature is present — G3
can add features, it cannot re-cut domains without a reopen.

Read: `matrix/features.yaml`, every file under `findings/`, and
`findings/ground-truth/reference-erd*.mermaid`.

## D1. Coverage against the findings

**Asks:** does every finding reach the matrix, and does every matrix entry descend from one?

- **5** — every lane-D finding maps to a feature or is explicitly out of scope with a reason;
  no feature cites evidence that is not in `findings/`.
- **3** — a handful of findings are unaccounted for, and the omissions look incidental rather
  than considered.
- **1** — whole finding files have no representation in the matrix, or features exist with no
  evidence at all.

**Cite below 4:** finding ids that reach no feature, and feature ids whose evidence resolves
to nothing.

## D2. Granularity consistency

**Asks:** are features cut at a comparable size, or does one domain hold "Authentication"
while another holds "Password field shows a strength meter"?

- **5** — a reader can predict, from any three features, roughly how big a fourth will be.
- **3** — one or two domains are visibly finer or coarser than the rest, without a stated
  reason.
- **1** — granularity varies by an order of magnitude within a single domain, which makes
  every downstream count (coverage %, slice size) meaningless.

**Cite below 4:** the specific feature ids at each end of the spread, in the same domain.

## D3. Orphan entities

**Asks:** does every entity in the reference ERD appear in some feature's `ground_truth`, and
does every entity a feature names exist in the ERD?

The orchestrator hands you `plan/gate-reviews/gate-1-facts.md` (from `gate_facts.py`): both directions are
listed there. Score from it, and cite from it.

- **5** — both directions clean, or every exception is annotated (`%% internal`, out of scope).
- **3** — a few entities appear in the ERD and in no feature; nobody has said whether that is
  scope or an oversight.
- **1** — features name entities the reference does not have, which means the taxonomy is
  partly invented.

**Cite below 4:** entity names, and the ERD file or feature id each is missing from.

## D4. Naming collisions and drift

**Asks:** does one concept have one name?

- **5** — canonical names are consistent across features, flows and the ERD; near-synonyms
  have been collapsed deliberately, and the reference's own term is recorded where it
  differs.
- **3** — two or three concepts carry a second name somewhere.
- **1** — the same concept appears under different names in different domains, so contracts
  and specs will inherit both.

**Cite below 4:** each pair of names and where each appears.

## D5. Domain boundaries as a first draft of contexts

**Asks:** G4a inherits these domains as the starting point for bounded contexts. Would it?

- **5** — the cuts follow how the *rebuild* should be designed; where they mirror the
  reference's module structure, that mirroring is called out as a decision.
- **3** — the cuts are the reference's directory layout, unexamined.
- **1** — domains cross-cut each other, so no context map can descend from them without a
  re-cut.

**Cite below 4:** the domains involved and the features that sit awkwardly across them.

## D6. Rule coverage

**Asks:** lane R turns the reference's behavior into cited Rule Cards. Did it reach the
behavior that actually matters, and does every card point at something real?

Read `findings/rules/*.yaml` against lane D's route and permission findings, and against
`reference-erd*.mermaid`.

- **5** — every `calculation` and `eligibility` route lane D found has at least one card;
  every card's `entities[]` appear in the ERD and its `features[]` in the matrix; each
  `then` names concrete values a test could assert on.
- **3** — the obvious rules are carded and a recognisable class is missing — no
  `state-transition` cards for an entity whose lane-D findings clearly describe a state
  machine, or a domain with routes and no rules at all. Also a 3 at most:
  - a domain whose lane-D routes document error responses (non-2xx statuses, error codes)
    but which has no `path_kind: error` card. `validate.py` prints the split per domain;
  - a property the reference keeps true in application code across several writers, carded
    only as per-operation rules and never as one `invariant`;
  - a state machine in `validate.py`'s **state machines** block with an unreachable state
    or no creation edge that the reference's source does not explain. Open the source and
    decide before citing it: an orphaned legacy state is a fact about the reference, while a
    missing edge is a missing card. A listed dead end is usually a terminal state. Cite it
    only when the source shows a way out that no card records.
- **1** — cards exist but restate the route rather than the rule ("then the invoice is
  validated"), so nothing downstream can test against them; or whole rule-bearing domains
  have no file.

**Cite below 4:** rule ids and the lane-D finding or route each missing rule belongs to;
for a weak `then`, quote it; for a missed invariant, the per-operation cards that share it.
An `invariant` card that only restates a database constraint (a `CHECK`, unique index,
foreign key or `NOT NULL`) belongs to lane D. Name it, whatever the score.

**Citation integrity is reported regardless of the score.** Re-derivation (see your agent
file) applies here with teeth: a card whose cited `path`/`commit`/`line` does not support
its `then` is named in this section **even when D6 otherwise scores 4 or 5**, because a
wrong citation is not a coverage problem and would otherwise have nowhere to appear.
Say which, and what the line actually says. Set `verification: re-derived` on the cards
that check out — you are the only agent that writes that field, and `validate.py` reports
how many are still `pending` for exactly this reason.

**Clean-room posture changes what good looks like.** Where `license-posture.md` restricts
lane D to no-code sources, lane R is `observed`/`inferred` only and no card can carry a
`line`. Score the coverage, not the basis, and say in *What I could not check* that none of
these cards was re-derivable against source.
