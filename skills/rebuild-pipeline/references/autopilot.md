# Autopilot — unattended stretches between gates

Autopilot runs the mechanical work the user would otherwise advance by typing "continue":
mining lanes, matrix and slice drafts, ADR and contract drafts, per-slice module builds,
parity reports. It **halts at every gate**. Locking stays a human act (SKILL.md Step 5) —
autopilot never runs `gate.py lock`, and `stop_at_gates` has no off switch.

It is off unless the user asks for it, and asking for it is not the same as consenting to
it. "Autopilot" earns a **brief**; only an explicit yes earns a run.

## Requirements

The 5-hour rate-limit window (`rate_limits.five_hour`) is piped by Claude Code to the
**status line only** — not to hooks, not into the conversation. Autopilot therefore reads
it from a snapshot the status line writes. Without that snapshot there is no usage
awareness, so `preflight` refuses to pass.

If preflight reports a missing snapshot, the user's statusLine command needs this, once:

```sh
rl=$(echo "$input" | jq -c 'if .rate_limits then
       {five_hour: .rate_limits.five_hour, seven_day: .rate_limits.seven_day, at: (now|floor)}
     else empty end' 2>/dev/null)
if [ -n "$rl" ]; then
  printf '%s\n' "$rl" > "$HOME/.claude/.rate-limits.json.tmp" 2>/dev/null \
    && mv -f "$HOME/.claude/.rate-limits.json.tmp" "$HOME/.claude/.rate-limits.json" 2>/dev/null
fi
```

**The context snapshot (recommended).** The orchestrator's own context size is also visible
only to the status line, which gets `transcript_path`. Add this block after the one above so
`check` can halt a run before its session gets expensive:

```sh
# --- Persist context size for tools that cannot see it ---
# The orchestrator's own context, in tokens, from the last main-thread `usage` in the
# transcript (input + cache read + cache creation). Only the status line gets
# `transcript_path`, so the rebuild pipeline's autopilot reads this snapshot to halt at a unit
# boundary once the session is too large. Keyed by directory (current and project dir), since
# autopilot cannot learn its own session id. Temp file + mv, as above.
ctx_dir="${REBUILD_CONTEXT_DIR:-$HOME/.claude/.context}"
tp=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.transcript_path // empty' 2>/dev/null)
if [ -n "$tp" ] && [ -f "$tp" ]; then
  ctx=$(tail -c 400000 "$tp" | jq -R -c 'fromjson? | select(.type=="assistant" and (.isSidechain|not) and .message.usage != null)
        | .message.usage | (.input_tokens + (.cache_read_input_tokens//0) + (.cache_creation_input_tokens//0))' 2>/dev/null | tail -1)
  if [ -n "$ctx" ]; then
    mkdir -p "$ctx_dir" 2>/dev/null
    for d in "$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.workspace.current_dir // .cwd // empty')" \
             "$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.workspace.project_dir // empty')"; do
      [ -n "$d" ] || continue
      f="$ctx_dir/$(printf '%s' "$d" | tr -c 'A-Za-z0-9' '-').json"
      jq -nc --argjson t "$ctx" --arg d "$d" '{tokens: $t, at: (now|floor), dir: $d}' > "$f.tmp" 2>/dev/null \
        && mv -f "$f.tmp" "$f" 2>/dev/null
    done
  fi
fi
```

Without it, autopilot still runs and `check` prints "context unknown": this is hygiene, not
a safety limit, so it fails open.

Two cases where it cannot work at all, and preflight says so rather than guessing:
`rate_limits` exists **only on Claude Pro/Max plans**, and a snapshot older than 15 minutes
means the status line has stopped rendering — **autopilot is interactive-session only**, so
it cannot run headless or from a cron job.

## Engaging

1. Steps 1–3 of the orchestration protocol as normal — locate, `gate.py status`, report.
2. `python3 scripts/autopilot.py preflight` and `python3 scripts/validate.py`.
   Preflight reuses `pause_check.py` wholesale, so a dirty tree, unpushed work in any
   `repos.yaml` repo, a stash, a gate reopened but not re-locked, or a stray dev server all
   surface here. Do not engage on a partial pass.
3. Present the **brief**:
   - current phase, from the script — not from memory of the conversation
   - the concrete units it will run, listed
   - **where it will stop**, named: "halts at Gate 2 with the slice plan drafted"
   - current 5h usage, the reset time, and the threshold
   - the session's context size and its limit (default 250k tokens)
   - anything preflight noted, including a previous run's `next_action`
4. **Get an explicit yes.** If the answer is qualified ("sure, but skip lane C"), fold that
   into the brief and re-confirm rather than interpreting it mid-run.
5. `python3 scripts/autopilot.py engage` — optionally `--threshold N` if the user wants
   headroom other than 80%, and `--context-tokens N` for a context limit other than 250k.

## The loop

Per unit of work:

1. `python3 scripts/autopilot.py check` — exit 3 means stop, whatever the reason. It is
   read-only and cheap; run it *before* the unit, never only after. It stops on the 5-hour
   window and on the session's own context size.
2. Do the unit. Delegate per `subagent-briefs.md`; run independent lanes in one turn. In G5 a
   unit's test evidence is the JUnit its lane wrote — never a suite you re-run after it to be
   sure (`g5-build.md`, "Test cadence within a slice"). While a lane has a long run open, the
   `lanes_check.py watch` from that file's guardrails runs here too, as one background process.
3. Write the output to disk and commit it.
4. `python3 scripts/autopilot.py log --unit "..." --outcome done|failed|skipped [--note "..."]`,
   chained with the next unit's check in the same call: `... log --unit "..." --outcome done && python3
   scripts/autopilot.py check`. Two adjacent calls were two orchestrator turns per unit, each re-reading
   the whole context, for one decision. The chain stops at the first failure and ends with `check`'s exit
   code, so an exit 3 still means stop.

Step 3 is the point of the whole design. A unit that ends with its output still in the
conversation is a unit that did not happen — an unattended run cannot be asked to
re-explain itself. Each `log` also commits the state file, which keeps the tree clean for
the `gate.py lock` the user will run at the halt.

## Halting

**At a gate.** Run `validate.py`, then dispatch the **rubric judge** (SKILL.md Step 5.1b) —
an unattended run is exactly where a semantic read of the artifacts is worth most, because
nobody has been looking over its shoulder for the last several hours. Then write the full gate
review to `plan/gate-reviews/gate-N.md` — what is being locked, the key decisions inside it,
open risks, what the rubric report flagged, what becomes immutable, and every point where the
draft diverged from `adr/playbook.md` or from the reference. Commit both files,
then `disengage --reason gate-review --next "..."`, run `pause_check.py`, and present the
review. The user decides; the file is there so the decision does not depend on scrollback.

**At a slice boundary.** Run the between-slices sequence in `g5-build.md` — record progress,
then `boundary.py <Sn>` (archive, parity, slice review, re-mine check), commit all of it — *before* halting for the "marking a slice done"
decision. The review is the artifact that decision gets made against, and an unattended run that
halts without writing one hands the user a question and none of the evidence for it.

**On trouble** — stop, do not work around:

| Situation | `--reason` |
|---|---|
| 5h window hits the threshold | `usage-threshold` |
| Session context hits its limit (`check` says so) | `context-threshold` |
| `validate.py` fails and the fix is not mechanical | `validate-failed` |
| `pause_check.py` goes ⚠️ | `pause-check-unsafe` |
| A subagent fails twice, or returns nothing | `error` |
| Intent is ambiguous (SKILL.md 4c), or a human decision is due | `needs-user-decision` |

**Decisions autopilot may take alone:** lane dispatch and finding merges, dedup, canonical
naming drafts, the dependency graph, slice-order drafts, ADR drafts against
`adr/playbook.md`, data-model and contract drafts, module specs, slice code against
locked contracts, parity reports, and fixing its own validation failures. Vendoring the
selected playbook to `adr/playbook.md` at G4a entry is also autopilot's to do — it is a copy,
not a decision. **Choosing or switching a playbook is not**: if the applicability check finds
that the selected playbook's `not-applicable-when:` describes this rebuild, halt with
`needs-user-decision` rather than picking another one or falling back to blank-slate.

**Decisions it must never take alone** — halt with `needs-user-decision`. These are
scattered across the phase references; this is the whole list:

- license posture, and the G0 remote-purpose question (durability, or durability + CI)
- `sources.yaml` review, and confirming the reference runs locally
- taxonomy approval and canonical-name spot-checks (G2)
- learning-weighting for slice order (G3)
- the G4a team-composition question — `g4a-architecture.md` says to ask it *every time*,
  because no other artifact in this pipeline records team facts
- each ADR decision, in dependency order (G4a) — drafting is delegable, deciding is not
- the G4b coherence and callee checks, including before a re-lock after a reopen
- spec approval before any code is written (G5). Once the user approves, cutting each lane's
  worktree and running `lane_plan.py` is autopilot's: the plan only carries the approval
  just given to the file the repo's spec gate reads (`g5-build.md` step 1b). So is
  `lane_plan.py --amend`, but only after the user has approved the corrected spec.
- **a lane that reports `Status: amending`**, meaning it found its approved spec wrong.
  Correcting the spec is a spec approval, so the halt is `needs-user-decision`, with the
  lane's report attached.
- a block from a code repo's own guard (`spec-gate-guard`, `bash-guard`, …) that the lane
  cannot resolve within the repo's rules. It is the harness speaking, so never edit a guard
  or its registration to get past it.
- **marking a slice done** — the slice is not done until deployed and `done_means` is
  demonstrably true
- **reordering the slice sequence** (`sequence.py reorder`). Generating the review that
  surfaces a reorder candidate is autopilot's; deciding to move a slice is not. It is a change
  to the plan, in the same register as a gate reopen, and `--reason` exists so that a human
  said why. `sync` after a gate-2 reopen *is* autopilot's — that is bookkeeping, and the
  decision was the reopen.
- adopting an upstream feature into the backlog (G6)
- the GP drills — the user performs them
- any gate reopen, and the reason for it
- creating a remote, and its visibility

## Pausing — identical to a user-initiated pause

1. Stop the current unit. If the guard hook blocked a write, `disengage` first — that
   unblocks writing, and the run is over either way.
2. Get in-flight work to disk as drafts (checkpoint discipline), commit, and **push** the
   workbench and every repo in `repos.yaml`.
3. `python3 scripts/autopilot.py disengage --reason <r> --next "<what comes next>"`
4. `python3 scripts/pause_check.py` — and resolve what it flags. Relaying the warning is not
   resolving it.
5. Report and stop:

```
⏸ AUTOPILOT PAUSED — 5h usage 81% (resets 14:20, in 1h 6m)
   Completed: 4 units — S4 spec, S4 backend, S4 frontend, S4 infra
   Next:      S5 spec  ·  ✅ safe to pause
   Continue when the window resets, or stop here?
```

Then **end the turn**. Do not start the next unit while asking. Nothing resumes on a timer;
the user comes back.

**On `context-threshold`, the fix is a fresh session, not a wait.** Every unit is already on
disk, so nothing is lost by clearing. Report it as:

```
⏸ AUTOPILOT PAUSED — context 262k tokens (limit 250k)
   Completed: 6 units — S4 spec … S5 backend
   Next:      S5 frontend  ·  ✅ safe to pause
   Run /clear, then /rebuild — the new session re-runs preflight and offers to resume.
```

Autopilot cannot clear its own context, so this is the one pause that always needs a human
keystroke. That is the trade: a few seconds per stop, against a session whose every turn
re-bills hundreds of thousands of tokens.

## Resuming

Re-run Steps 1–3 and `preflight` from scratch — usage has moved, the tree may have changed,
and a gate may have been locked while you were away. `engaged_phase` and
`paused.next_action` in `plan/autopilot.yaml` are breadcrumbs for a human reading the file;
`gate.py status` is the authority. Re-brief, re-confirm, re-engage. After a
`context-threshold` pause in a fresh session, the brief is the previous plan minus the units
already logged; when nothing else changed (preflight clean, same phase), a one-line confirmation
is enough. A run left `engaged` by
a session that died is not a run in progress — preflight flags it, and engaging again
overwrites the state while preserving the log.

## The threshold is a limit, not a budget

`hooks/scripts/autopilot_guard.py` blocks Write/Edit once an engaged run crosses its
threshold, because a rule about stopping is at its weakest exactly when it matters — mid-unit,
with the end apparently close.

It fails **open** until an engaged run is established — not in a workbench, no
`plan/autopilot.yaml`, status not `engaged`: allowed, always, because none of those is an
autopilot write and the guard must never break an unrelated edit. After that it fails
**closed**: a missing, unreadable or stale snapshot blocks too, since an unverifiable window
is not a low one and the run has already declared itself unattended. If the status line
breaks mid-run, autopilot stops rather than losing its threshold silently.

Two consequences worth knowing:

- **A run left `engaged` by a session that died will block your manual edits** in that
  workbench. The block message names the fix: `disengage --reason error`. Preflight flags the
  same leftover state before it can bite.
- **A blocked subagent gets different instructions.** A miner or spec-writer that trips the
  threshold is told to stop and report upward, explicitly *not* to run `disengage` — ending
  the run belongs to the orchestrator, which is the only party that knows the `next_action`.

The staleness bounds differ on purpose: `check` allows 15 minutes, the hook allows 45. The
status line re-renders at tool-call *boundaries*, not during a call — a 100-second call was
measured updating at each end with a 95-second silence between. `check` runs at unit
boundaries, moments after a render. The hook can fire twenty minutes into a slice build, where
an old snapshot is normal and nothing is wrong.
