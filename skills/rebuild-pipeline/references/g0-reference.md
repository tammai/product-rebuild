# G0 — Reference selection + license posture

Goal: pick the reference and record the legal posture BEFORE any agent reads anything.

## Onboarding interview (ask, don't assume)
1. Which reference product, or which category? If category only, propose 2–3 concrete
   OSS candidates and compare: domain fit, codebase readability for the user's stack
   familiarity, upstream activity (parity loop needs a living reference), deployability.

   **A reference the user already owns is a first-class case**, not a degenerate one:
   "rebuild our own legacy app on a new stack" is the same pipeline with three fields
   different. Record `reference.kind: own-code` and `reference.upstream: frozen` (a legacy
   app that is being replaced has stopped shipping), and note what that turns off — G6's
   upstream re-mine has nothing to track, and question 2 stops being about someone else's
   licence. Everything else gets *easier*, not weaker: lane D is unrestricted, the running
   instance is the app the user already has, and the old app is a permanent arbiter for
   ambiguous behavior rather than a moving target. Ask whether the *replacement* is meant to
   be distributed differently from the original (open-sourced, sold, handed to a client);
   that is still a posture decision, just about their code rather than a third party's.
2. Distribution intent — this is the license-posture decision:
   - Private/learning use → reading any OSS source (incl. GPL/AGPL) as reference is
     low-risk; full lane-D mining allowed.
   - Possible closed-source distribution later → treat copyleft references clean-room:
     mine behavior via running product/docs/API only; lane D restricted to no-code sources.
   - Permissive reference (MIT/Apache/BSD) → no restriction; vendoring allowed with attribution.
   Record the answer in `license-posture.md`. State clearly you are not a lawyer; if
   distribution plans are ambiguous, recommend professional advice before locking G0.
3. Optional secondary reference for UX comparison only.
4. **What is being rebuilt, and against which architecture playbook.** Two fields, one
   question, both written to `sources.yaml`'s `architecture:` block and both read by four
   later phases — ask them here because G4a is weeks away and the answers change G4b, G5
   and GP as well as G4a:
   - `target_shape`: `fullstack` (the rebuild owns backend and frontend) or `client-only`
     (the API already exists and stays put; the rebuild is one client against it). Ask it
     plainly — "does this rebuild include the backend, or does it talk to an API that
     already exists and isn't changing?" — because the answer flips G4b from *drafting* a
     contract to *transcribing* one, and a project that discovers this at Gate 4 has mined
     the wrong lane D.
   - `playbook`: which entry in the plugin's `references/playbooks/` supplies G4a's standing
     answers. Offer what is there (`web-modular-monolith`, the org default for `fullstack`;
     `mobile-flutter` for a Flutter client), a workbench-local path if the user has written
     their own, or `none` to make every G4a ADR a blank-slate decision. Read the candidate's
     `not-applicable-when:` frontmatter aloud before recording it — that list is the
     applicability check G4a would otherwise run for the first time weeks later, and
     discovering there that no playbook fits is the expensive way to learn it.

   A user rebuilding their own React Native app in Flutter answers: `kind: own-code`,
   `upstream: frozen`, `target_shape: client-only`, `playbook: mobile-flutter`.
5. **Has this rebuild been tried before?** By whom, how far it got, why it stopped, and
   what survives — a branch, a half-done schema, a doc, an ADR someone wrote and lost the
   argument about. Ask it now because a failed prior attempt is the cheapest possible
   source of ground truth about where this one will get hard, and because the parts that
   survive are either inputs or traps, and only the user can say which. "No, first attempt"
   is a complete answer; write it down so the question is not re-asked at G4a. Record under
   `## Prior attempts` in `license-posture.md`.
6. **What may agents not touch or read?** Paths inside the reference, adjacent repos,
   production systems, customer data, anything under legal hold. For an `own-code`
   reference this is the question that does the most work — the user's own monorepo has
   corners that are somebody else's, and the miners have no way to know. Record under
   `## Off-limits` in `license-posture.md`, and then **put every path and URL from the
   answer into `sources.yaml`'s `denied:` list**: the prose is for the human, the deny list
   is the thing the miners actually read, and an off-limits path recorded only in prose is
   an instruction that exists nowhere an agent will see it.

## Actions
- Scaffold: `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/rebuild-pipeline/scripts/rebuild_init.py <name>`
- Fill `sources.yaml`: exactly what agents may fetch/clone, derived from the posture.
  If clean-room: the reference repo goes on the deny list.
- **Give the workbench a remote now, before mining starts.** Everything the pipeline is
  about to produce — taxonomy, ADRs, gate history — is unreproducible: re-mining the
  reference yields different findings, not the decisions you argued yourself into. Waiting
  until "there's something worth backing up" means the loss window covers G1 and G2, the
  phases with the most output.
  ```sh
  gh repo create <name>-workbench --private --source . --push
  # Durability-only remote? Turn the host's CI off so pushes stay silent:
  gh api -X PUT repos/<owner>/<name>-workbench/actions/permissions -F enabled=false
  ```
  Pushing stays manual and stays your job: `python3 scripts/pause_check.py` flags anything that has not
  left the machine before a session ends, but nothing pushes on your behalf. That includes
  **gate tags** — every `gate.py lock` mints a `gate-N/vN` tag that code repos consume as a
  submodule pin, and `git push` sends no tags (nor does `--follow-tags`: these are
  lightweight). After every lock: `git push && git push --tags`.
  Ask which the remote is for — durability only, or durability *and* hosted CI — and record the
  answer. It decides that last line here and step 4 of G5's repo checklist. The scaffold ships
  a `validate.yml` that does pass on a hosted runner, but the code repos' workflows will not
  (see G5's private-submodule trap), so "we push to GitHub" and "GitHub runs our CI" need to be
  separate decisions rather than one assumption.
  **Visibility follows the posture just decided.** `private-learning` or
  `possible-closed-distribution` → private, non-negotiable: pushing the rebuild to a public
  remote is distribution, which neither posture covers, and would need a G0 reopen. The
  mechanism differs by reference — a copyleft reference makes it a licensing problem, a
  proprietary one a terms/trade-secret problem — but the answer is private either way. Only
  `permissive-reference` leaves it open. Say this out loud when you create the repo —
  the user chose the posture minutes ago and will not connect it to a `gh` flag.
- Confirm the user can run the reference locally (Docker preferred; for a mobile reference,
  the old app installed on a real device or simulator, ideally from a backup of a real
  install — see `g1-mining.md`). This becomes a hard G1 exit requirement.
- **Run the preflight, last, once everything above is filled in.** From the workbench root:
  ```sh
  python3 scripts/preflight.py                              # detect
  python3 scripts/preflight.py --run-build --run-tests   # …and execute the reference's own build/test commands
  ```
  It writes `PREFLIGHT.md` and `preflight.json`, with a verdict of **Ready**,
  **Ready-with-gaps** or **Not-ready**, and a per-lane line saying which of A–D can
  actually start. This is the check that used to be the bullet above it: "confirm the user
  can run the reference" was a promise nothing verified, and the miners started on it.
  Every lane-D finding cites `path + pinned_commit`, so a checkout sitting at a different
  commit writes citations that are wrong the moment they are written and stay wrong through
  a gate lock that hashes them.

  **Not-ready blocks G1 dispatch and nothing else.** `sources.yaml` and `license-posture.md`
  commit and push regardless — none of the causes changes a G0 decision, they change whether
  it is honest to start mining. Fix the cause and re-run; it is idempotent.

  Executing the build and test commands is opt-in (`--run-build`, `--run-tests`) because
  they are arbitrary commands out of a third party's CI, the same source `agents/miner.md`
  treats as untrusted input. Detected-but-not-executed is recorded as a gap and named as
  unproven, never as a pass — so `Ready-with-gaps` is the right verdict for a reference
  whose build nobody has watched succeed.
- **Say what G5 will do to a code repo**, so the user hears it at the start rather than at the
  first lane: the repo is created by this plugin's `scaffold-repo` skill from the locked
  playbook's scaffold manifest (nothing else needs to be installed, and no stack is invented
  at G5: Gate 3 refuses a playbook with no manifest). The plugin's own guards then run for every
  lane, including a spec gate that blocks large edits until the worktree has an approved
  `PLAN.md`. The pipeline writes each lane's plan from the slice specs the user approves. That
  approval is the one the gate checks, and no second approval is asked for (`g5-build.md` step
  1b). Say too that the scaffold is a skeleton whose five commands pass on day one, not a
  feature kit: the first slice builds the first real module.

## Exit criteria
Reference chosen with recorded rationale; `license-posture.md` complete;
`sources.yaml` reviewed by the user, including `reference.kind`, `reference.upstream`, and
the `architecture:` block (playbook + target shape); workbench scaffolded and CI green on empty state;
workbench pushed to a remote whose visibility matches the recorded posture
(`python3 scripts/pause_check.py` confirms nothing is still local-only); **`PREFLIGHT.md` reads Ready
or Ready-with-gaps** (`python3 scripts/preflight.py` — Not-ready holds G1 dispatch, and only that).
