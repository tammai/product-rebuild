// slice-review.mjs — the between-slices standing report. Run from the workbench root.
// Usage:
//   node scripts/slice-review.mjs [<Sn>]      # defaults to the most recently shipped slice
//
// Writes plan/slice-reviews/<Sn>.md and prints a summary. ADVISORY: it locks nothing, blocks
// nothing, and starting the next slice without it is allowed. Its job is to make "where do we
// stand" answerable at a slice boundary without anyone reconstructing it from scrollback.
//
// WHY IT IS GENERATED AND NOT WRITTEN
//
// Everything here comes off disk: plan/progress.yaml, plan/sequence.yaml, the AC suite's JUnit
// output, matrix/features.yaml. None of it is composed. A slice review an agent writes is a
// summary of what that agent believes it did, which is the failure `verifier`, `rubric-judge`
// and g5-build.md's "a verification script names only what it RAN" all exist to prevent — and a
// slice review is exactly the artifact that outlives the session that produced it. So the
// script states facts and cites their source; judgement goes in the conversation on top of it,
// and anything it could not establish says so rather than going quiet.
//
// WHAT IT ADDS THAT PARITY DOES NOT
//
// parity.mjs answers "how much of the REFERENCE do we cover" — a coverage diff against the
// matrix. Two questions it does not answer, and nothing else did either:
//   - Does the whole product still run? Every per-slice deploy criterion asserts only that
//     slice's features, so "did S3 break S1" had no home. Comparing this AC run against the
//     previous one, by test name, gives it one.
//   - Where does that put us on the roadmap? Position in the execution order, what is next,
//     what is now orderable — the input to the between-slices reorder conversation.

## 1. Does it run?

The cumulative question — not "did this slice's tests pass", which its deploy criterion already
asserted, but "is everything built so far still passing".

${md.run.join("\n")}

## 2. What shipped

${md.shipped.length ? md.shipped.join("\n") : "- this slice lists no features"}
${lanePlanMd.length ? `\nLane plans (\`plan/lane-plans/${sliceId}.yaml\`):\n\n${lanePlanMd.join("\n")}\n` : ""}${unrecorded.length ? `\n${unrecorded.length} of them have no \`plan/progress.yaml\` entry. Record them under \`features:\` — until then they count as uncovered here and fall back to mining status in the parity report.\n` : ""}${(slice.learning_goals || []).length ? `\nLearning goals: ${slice.learning_goals.join(" · ")}\n` : ""}
## 3. Where that puts us

\`\`\`
${bar(shippedSlices.length, order.length)}  ${shippedSlices.length} of ${order.length} slices shipped
${bar(recordedCovered, inScope)}  ${recordedCovered} of ${inScope} features recorded covered (${pct}%)${descoped ? `, ${descoped} descoped (not counted)` : ""}
\`\`\`

Coverage here counts **only explicit \`plan/progress.yaml\` entries**${noEntry ? `; ${noEntry} of ${matrix.length} matrix features have none yet` : ""}.
\`parity.mjs\` reports a different figure over the same matrix because it fills gaps with
\`matrix/features.yaml\`'s \`status:\`, which is gate-1 mining output — how well the *reference*
covered each feature. Both are correct for their own question; this one is about the rebuild.

Order (${orderSource}):

${order.map((id) => `${id === sliceId ? "→" : " "} ${id} ${byId.get(id)?.name || ""} — ${statusOf(id)}`).join("\n")}

Next: **${next ? `${next} ${byId.get(next)?.name || ""}` : "nothing pending — every slice has shipped"}**

## 4. Pressure on the plan

${md.pressure.join("\n")}

## 5. What did this slice teach the runbook?

\`plan/BUILD_RUNBOOK.md\` is required reading for every backend, frontend and infra lane from
S2 on, which makes it the one artifact whose staleness compounds: a lane reads it, believes
it, and rediscovers the truth the expensive way. This is the boundary where the answer is
still in reach.

${runbookMd.join("\n")}

## The decision

Accept this slice and start ${next || "GP"}, or name what has to come back first. Either way it
is yours — nothing here enforces it. If the plan should change, do it now, at the boundary:
slice *order* is \`npm run sequence -- reorder\` (logged, cheap); what is IN a slice is still a
gate-2 reopen (\`npm run gate -- reopen gate-2 --reason "..."\`).
